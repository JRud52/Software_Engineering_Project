# Software_Engineering_Project
Software Engineering Project 2017  

Will use ASP.net MVC template.

We should maintain a folder structure similar to this:

```
  root
    bin -> for the build (excluded from the git repo)
    doc -> for the documentation, including generated docs
    lib -> for any external libraries that we use
    src -> for the source code
```

I would suggest that we use Visual Studio Community 2015 or Xamarin Studio(Monodevelop) for consistency sake.  

The [Projects](https://github.com/JRud52/Software_Engineering_Project/projects/1) tab will contain the Kanban chart which should be refered to regularily.  
For further information, refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/JRud52/Software_Engineering_Project/wiki).  
Please use XML comments so that we can automatically generate documentation from those comments.
