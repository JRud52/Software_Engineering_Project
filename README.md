Going to use C#, so GUI is pretty easy. 

We should maintain a folder structure similar to this:

```
  root
    src -> for the source code
    bin -> for the build (excluded from the git repo)
    lib -> for any external libraries that we use
```

I would suggest that we use https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/ for the C# IDE so that it is cross platform.
