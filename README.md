Software Engineering Project 2017  

Going to use C#, so GUI is pretty easy. 

We should maintain a folder structure similar to this:

```
  root
    src -> for the source code
    bin -> for the build (excluded from the git repo)
    lib -> for any external libraries that we use
```

I would suggest that we use visual studio community 2017 for this: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-2017-rc/
